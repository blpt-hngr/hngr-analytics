=================
The hngr pixel can be easily added to any site. It provides limited information however, and cookies are limited in specific browsers (especially Safari on iOS). Place the below tag somewhere near the end of your site's `<body>` section.

```
<img alt="hngr-pixel" src="https://ham.hngr.co/ham.gif"/>
```
